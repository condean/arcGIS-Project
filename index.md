<h1 style="text-align: center;">ArcGIS Scavenger Hunt Workshop</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Welcome to Underdog Technology’s GisArc Pro
workshop. In this workshop you will learn the basics of what
GIS technology is and how to use the program GisArc Pro
application inorder to explore many maps and the data that
can be found in those maps. In general GIS technology
stands for Geographic Information Systems. It is a computer
tool that is used to examine many different types of data on a
geographical map. With this tool you can find geographical
data of your local neighborhood. Though this is a very basic
explanation of GIS, at the beginning of this workshop your
instructor will explain GIS more in detail and will answer any
questions you may have. As you go through the different
tutorials you will be able to understand GIS more and how to
use the GisArc Pro application. After each tutorial you will be
tasked with a scavenger hunt where you will be given a hint
and tasked to find location using what you have learned from
the tutorials. Through these scavenger hunts you will learn a
little more about St.Louis City as you explore the city’s map
and its accompanying data.
